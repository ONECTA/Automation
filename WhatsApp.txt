ग्राहकांनी घ्यावयास हवी काळजी.

1) मीटर चे रिडींग घेण्यास येणाऱ्या व्यक्तीचे नाव, ID प्रूफ, आणि रिडींग घेतल्या तारखेला त्याची सही घेणे
2) पुढल्या वेळेस हे रिडींग 30 दिवसांनी घेतले जाते का नाही ह्याची खात्री करणे.
3) पुढल्या वेळेचे रिडींग 30 दिवसा नंतर घेण्यास आल्यास त्याला रिडींग घेण्यास मनाई करून त्वरित त्याची तक्रार विद्युत महामंडळाच्या अधिकाऱ्यानं कडे लेखी करणे.
4) बिल्डिंग सोसायटी असल्यास सेक्रेटरींनी आपल्या बिल्डिंगच्या वॉचमन कडून ह्या गोष्टी करावयास लावाव्यात.

100 रिडींग पर्यंत 3.76 रुपये प्रति युनिट आहे.

परंतु रिडींग 30 दिवसा नंतर घेतल्या मुळे रिडींग 
* 100 च्या वर रिडींग गेल्यास हेच दर दुप्पट म्हणजेच 7.21 रुपये प्रति युनिट आहे.
 * 300 च्या वर रिडींग गेल्यास दर तिप्पट 9.95 रुपये प्रति युनिट आहे.
* 500 च्या वर रिडींग गेल्यास चौपट 11.31 रुपये प्रति युनिट आहे.

आपल्याला येणारे वाढीव बिल हे वरील एकमेव कारणाने येत आहेत, आमच्या विद्युत महामंडळाच्या कामचोर कर्मचाऱ्यांमुळे सामान्य जनतेस भुर्दंड भरावयास लागत आहे.
तरी आपण सर्वांनी वरील गोष्टी कटाक्षाने पळून आमच्या  कामचोर कर्मचाऱ्यांना वठणीस आणाव ही विनंती🙏🏽

09/10/16, 5:58 pm - ‪+91 95275 39581‬: Car owners in India please read this.

This is for all car owners. -Victim Mr.Arunkumar:

How to Lock Your Car and Why! 

"I locked my car. As I walked away I heard my car door unlock. I went back and locked my car again three times. Each time, as soon as I started to walk away, I could hear it unlock again!!

Naturally alarmed, I looked around and there were two men sitting in a car next to the Store. They were obviously watching me intently, and there seemed no doubt they were somehow involved in this very weird situation.

I quickly abandoned my errand, jumped into my car and sped away. I went straight to the police station, told them what had happened, and found out
I was part of a new, and very successful, scheme being used to gain entry into parked cars.

Two weeks later, my friend's son had a similar experience....While traveling, he stopped at a motorway service area to use the toilet. When he came out to his car less than 5 minutes later, someone had managed to get into his car and had stolen his mobile phone, laptop computer, sat-nav, briefcase and other belongings.

He called the police and since there were no signs of his car having been broken into, the police told him he had probably been a victim of the latest robbery tactic – there is a device that robbers are using now to clone your security code when you lock your doors on your car using your remote locking device.

They sit a distance away and watch for their next victim. They know you are going inside the Store, restaurant, or whatever and that they now
have a few minutes to steal and run.

The police officer said always to lock your car manually with the key when parking in a public area. That way if there is someone sitting in a car nearby watching for their next victim, it will not be you.

When you lock up with the key upon exiting, it does not send the security code, but if you walk away and use the remote button, it sends the code
through the airwaves where it can be easily intercepted by the device.

This is very real. Be aware of what you just read and please pass this information on...

Look how many times we all lock our doors with our remote just to be sure we remembered to lock them -- and bingo, someone has our code...and potentially whatever is in our car."

Please share with everyone you know in the hope that we can stop these thieves!
09/10/16, 6:01 pm - ‪+91 95275 39581‬: This is repetition of similar message received in the past.Worth reading and internalising .
09/10/16, 6:02 pm - ‪+91 82377 32882‬: Since your reading is not taken every month, it gets accumulated crosses 100 reading Mark and you pay higher...which u w'd not have if reading was taken on regular basis..
Insist mseb in complaint that they r not taking reading on periodical basis.
09/10/16, 6:19 pm - ‪+91 82377 32882‬: For first 100 readings, bill is rs 3.76 per unit.
Reading 100-300,7.21 rs per unit
Reading 300-500, 9.95 rs per unit
Reading above 500, 11.31 rs per unit
Compare other readings with 1st one...it's 2,3,4 times basic below 100 units readings that's y u end up paying higher..

Opinion of a civilian ! 
Hits the nail on the head ! All sensible Indians will definitely support this view...

*Dear P.M.*
*Shri Narendra Modi ji,*

*Namaskar !*

*Make this change and the country will recognize your leadership...*

*Life time pension accorded for one tenure of politicians - is gross injustice compared to the rest of the government servants who have to put in a minimum of 20 years of service. This is a drain on the public exchequer.* 

*No one has been able to explain why young men &  women who serve in the Military for 20 years or more, risking their lives protecting our freedom get only 50% of their pay on retirement & Short Service Commissioned Officers who also risk their life for a term varying from 5-14 yrs - get ZERO retirement benefits after their assignment.*

*But Politicians who hold their political positions in the safe confines of the capital, protected by these very same men &  women, receive Full-Pay on retirement after serving just one term of 5 yrs. Does it make any sense ???*

*PM SIR, CHANGE THIS RULE AND THE NATION SHALL BE GRATEFUL TO YOU FOREVER...*

*Abolish, politicians' pension for life.*

*Just like you motivated common people to give up subsidy, motivate MPs to give up numerous undeserving exorbitant perks and subsidies granted unanimously by themselves, including pension.*

*And we hope it starts with yourself... You are a great motivator...*

*Thanking you in anticipation of a favourable response,*

_Yours sincerely..._

_*[ If each person who receives this forwards it to 20 people, in 3 days, most people will have this message, and it may lead to a national campaign.*_

If you choose not to pass it on, you still have made a choice. These brave soldiers have given you that right to "freedom" for which they pay dearly...! ]

Jai HIND!...🇮🇳

But a politician can fight Elections while in jail😝If you have ever been in jail then you can never get a Govt. job. But a Politician could have been in jail any numbers of times and then also he can become PM or President.😝 You have to be a graduate to get any ordinary job in a bank. But if a politician is illiterate still he can become India's finance minister.😝 If you feel that this system needs to be changed, then support by spreading this message👏👏👏

When Madhavi asked Mr.Shane to stop, why and by whose authority he still decided to misbehave?
